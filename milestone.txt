Final Project Milestone
==============================

Project Title: Speed-Cubing Timer
Your Name: Nikolaus Lindinger

Overview
--------
Making progress. One issue was working with the existing API (as explained in the proposal). It did not work due to CORS issues, which I was not able to resolve in the AWS console. Instead I had to redeploy the underlying Java project with an updated handler that adds the required response headers to avoid CORS blocking. Now it works.
Another difficulty is adding a count aligned to the right into the dropdown. Standard select does not support this along with the event name. Will need bigger changes to add the counter.

None. (Also no SVG library since this is supported by default)
