Border-box root inheritance applied and Flexbox utilized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Add event handlers to support user interaction                            | 10         | 10             | `app.js` attaches event listeners for user interaction (keydown).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Create, modify, or remove DOM elements                                    | 10         | 10             | DOM manipulation is present in`app.js` and related modules. ClassList has been utilized. Code is very advanced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Use classes and modules to organize frontend code (at least two classes)  | 10         | 5              | `solvesManager.js` and `timer.js` define classes. Modular structure is used, but only two clear classes. Code in app.js should be organized in a class, difficult to read. You are waiting for DOMContentLoaded -> in case of modules/classes code is executed after DOM has been loaded... However, I think you invested a lot time and it is okay. |
| Use fetch to access your backend                                          | 10         | 10             | `app.js` uses `fetch()` to communicate with your api on aws (POST).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Notes:

Great job, the only critique I have is that the code in app.js should be organized in a class. You have utilized an external API, developed by you. However, you could have implemented a simple backend by yourself, which establishes communication with the other backend. I have to reduce the points in this category a little bit, to be fair. I think you invested a lot of time in the frontend and the project is very advanced. So I am fine with it. I really like your final project, the documentation is very good.
